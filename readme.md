# Social Network Back-end

## Description
The purpose of this Node.js application is to showcase the power and flexibility of MongoDB, Mongoose, and Nodejs in the form of a back-end for a mock social networking site. With this application a user will be able to make multiple application programming interface (API) calls. where the user would be able to update the database by creating, updating, gathering, and deleting data. by giving the user the opportunity to preform multiple C.R.U.D operations the user will get a better understanding and introduction to the complexities that go into a backend for a social media website.

## Usage

 To use this application the user must first have node, Insomnia, and code editor installed. once the user has met these requirements and has cloned the repo they must open the projects terminal and write npm i to install the dependencies. and finally node server.js to start the server. after that the user may go into Insomnia and begin to preform C.R.U.D operations. If the user wants more information of the project they can look at the comments in the project explaining the code. here is a link to the demo click [here]()
